# Keras-real-time-age-gender-estimation-demo
I use the following code to train the keras model
https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation

## Demo

Change the video name of the code for your demo
```
clip = VideoFileClip('mewtwo.mp4') # can be gif or movie
```

Unlike the demo.py in https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation
,I made several adjustment for the demo.

***Use [[moviepy]] instead of [[cv2]] for the frame of the video!!!***
